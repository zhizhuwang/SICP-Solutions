the sum of two intervals is: [aL, aH] + [bL, bH] = [aL + bL, aH + bH]

 width of new interval is : 
 1/2 * [(aH + bH) - (aL + bL)] 
= 1/2 *[(aH - aL) + (bH - bL)]
= width of a + width of b

the difference of two intervals is: [aL, aH] - [bL, bH] = [aL - bH, aH - bL]

 width of new interval is : 
 1/2 * [(aH - bL) - (aL - bH)]
 = 1/2 * [(aH - aL) - (bH - bL)]
 = width of a - width of b
