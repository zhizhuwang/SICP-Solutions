In Louis Reasoner's solution, for every k in (enumerate-interval 1 board-size), (queen-cols (- k 1)) has to be called to produce the (k-1)'s board positions.

In ex 2.42, for every board position in (queen-cols (- k 1)), use (enumerate-interval 1 board-size) to produce board-size different board positions. 

The board positions that produces in the first case is nearly board-size times more than the later case.
